## Principles

SeedPay is designed around five core principles:

1. **Backward compatible with BitTorrent** — SeedPay extends the existing wire protocol via BEP 10 (Extension Protocol). Non-SeedPay clients continue to work without modification.

2. **Opt-in** — No forced payments. Users choose whether to participate in the paid tier or use free BitTorrent as usual.

3. **Blockchain-agnostic** — Solana is the initial target chain, but the protocol is designed to be extensible to Ethereum, L2s, and other chains.

4. **Minimal trust required** — Payment verification is done on-chain. Seeders verify payments independently via blockchain state — they never trust client-reported data.

5. **Privacy-preserving** — On-chain payments cannot be linked to download activity. Ephemeral session keys (ECDH-based) replace raw PeerIDs in on-chain memos.

## Participation Model

Users can participate in both directions:

- **Earn**: Seed files and receive payments from leechers
- **Spend**: Pay seeders to download files quickly

This creates a **circular economy**: users earn USDC by seeding, then spend it on downloads, all within the same payment system.

```
User A: Seeds 10GB → Earns 0.1 USDC
User A: Downloads 5GB → Spends 0.05 USDC
Result: User A has 0.05 USDC remaining (net earner)
```

### Getting Started as a User

Users can enter the economy in multiple ways:

1. **Add funds** (buy USDC) for immediate download access
2. **Seed popular content** to earn USDC from other users
3. **Offset costs** by seeding and earning while downloading
4. **Become a net earner** by seeding more than downloading

## Protocol Version

This documentation covers **SeedPay v0.3**, which introduces:

- Ephemeral Session Keys (ECDH-based) for privacy
- Unidirectional payment channels with streaming micropayments
- Simplified protocol focused on crypto-native users with direct payments
- Ratio credits system dropped in favor of simpler implementation
