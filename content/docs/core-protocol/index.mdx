The SeedPay payment flow consists of four sequential phases:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Handshake

    Peers exchange BEP 10 extended handshakes to advertise SeedPay support and payment terms (wallet, price, chain). Non-SeedPay clients are unaffected.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Payment Channel Setup

    The Leecher and Seeder perform an ECDH key exchange to derive an ephemeral Session UUID. The Leecher then opens a unidirectional payment channel by depositing USDC into an on-chain escrow.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verification

    The Seeder independently verifies the payment channel on-chain — checking the deposit amount, session binding, and freshness. Only after verification does the Seeder unchoke the Leecher.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Data Transfer

    Standard BitTorrent piece requests proceed. The Leecher sends signed off-chain payment checks as data is downloaded. The Seeder tracks cumulative cost and pauses if payment checks fall behind.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Properties

| Property | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Micropayments** | As low as $0.0001/MB via streaming payment checks |
| **Low on-chain cost** | Only 2 transactions per session (open + close channel) |
| **Privacy** | ECDH session keys — no peer_id or IP on-chain |
| **Fair exchange** | Seeder only serves data when payment checks are sufficient |
| **Forward secrecy** | Ephemeral keys deleted after session |
