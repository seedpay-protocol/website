V0.3 introduces ephemeral session keys to ensure **payment privacy** — blockchain observers cannot link wallet addresses to download activity.

## Privacy Guarantees

### 1. Unlinkability (Blockchain to Swarm)

Blockchain observers see:

```
wallet_A → wallet_B, memo: { session_hash: "0xabc..." }
```

They **cannot** determine:
- Which torrent is being downloaded
- Which peer_id is involved
- Which IP address is associated

The `session_hash` is `SHA-256(Session_UUID)` — preimage resistance of SHA-256 prevents reversing it.

### 2. Unlinkability (Session to Session)

- Each TCP connection uses **fresh ephemeral keys**
- Different sessions produce different Session_UUIDs
- Blockchain observers cannot link multiple payments from the same user across sessions

### 3. Forward Secrecy

- Ephemeral keys are **deleted after the session ends**
- Compromising a wallet after the fact cannot decrypt past sessions
- Past download history remains private

## What is NOT Private

Not all metadata is hidden:

| Visible To | Information |
|-----------|-------------|
| Blockchain observers | The fact that `wallet_A` paid `wallet_B` (amounts and timing) |
| Swarm participants | Seeder wallet addresses (visible in handshake) |
| ISP / network observer | Connection metadata (IP addresses, timing, volume) |

## Privacy Best Practices

<Callout title="Recommendations">
  - Use **Tor or VPN** for IP address privacy
  - Use **burner wallets** funded via mixers for maximum anonymity
  - Avoid reusing the same Seeder/Leecher wallet combination if privacy is critical
