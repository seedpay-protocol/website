SeedPay's security model is built on three pillars: **privacy** (unlinkable on-chain payments), **payment verification** (blockchain as source of truth), and **economic attack resistance** (bounded losses, front-run resistance).

## Threat Model

SeedPay considers the following adversaries:

| Adversary | Capabilities | Mitigations |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Blockchain observer** | Can see all on-chain transactions | ECDH session keys — no peer_id or IP on-chain |
| **Network eavesdropper** | Can observe TCP connections | MSE tunnel encrypts all SeedPay messages |
| **Malicious seeder** | May send corrupted data or refuse to serve | BitTorrent hash verification, bounded loss per piece |
| **Malicious leecher** | May refuse to pay after receiving data | Seeder tracks payment checks before serving |
| **Sybil attacker** | Creates many fake identities | Economic cost of channel opening deters spam |

## Key Guarantees

- **No peer_id on-chain** — blockchain observers cannot link wallets to swarm activity
- **Session unlinkability** — different sessions produce different Session_UUIDs
- **Forward secrecy** — ephemeral keys are deleted after sessions
- **Bounded loss** — maximum loss per session is bounded by channel deposit (leecher) or cost of 1 piece (seeder)
- **Front-run resistance** — smart contract enforces monotonically increasing amounts
