## Multi-Chain Support

The ECDH-based session binding is chain-agnostic and can be implemented on:

- **Ethereum** — Use EIP-3009 for meta-transactions
- **Base, Arbitrum, Optimism** — L2s with low fees
- Other EVM-compatible chains

<Callout>
  Multi-chain support is planned for a future version. V1 targets Solana as the initial chain.
</Callout>

## Advanced Payment Models

### Current: Unidirectional Channels (V1)

SeedPay V1 uses unidirectional channels (Leecher → Seeder only) because:

- Seeders earn, Leechers pay (one direction of value flow)
- Simpler state management (no need for both parties to sign updates)
- Lower risk (only Leecher's deposit is at risk)
- Sufficient for the core use case of paid file downloads

### Future: Bidirectional Payment Channels

Bidirectional channels would allow both parties to send payments, enabling:

- Refunds or disputes
- Two-way value exchange
- More complex payment flows

These require more complex state management with both parties signing updates.

### Future: Probabilistic Payments

Lottery-style micropayments for extreme scalability:

- Trade certainty for reduced transaction count
- Useful for very high-frequency, low-value transactions

### Future: Multi-Hop Payment Routing

Allow payments through intermediate nodes (similar to Lightning Network):

- Enables payment channel networks
- Requires routing protocol and liquidity management

## Ratio Credits (V2 Consideration)

<Callout>
  Ratio credits are **deferred to V2**. V1 focuses on direct payments via payment channels.
</Callout>

V2 MAY add ratio credits if user research indicates:

- Strong demand for non-monetary credits
- Need for better privacy (credits vs direct payments)
- Anti-Sybil mechanisms that credits can provide
- Demand from non-crypto users

### Design Challenges

- Preventing Sybil attacks (users farming credits with fake seeders)
- Ensuring credits have real value (tied to actual bandwidth provision)
- Cross-torrent credit portability
- On-chain vs off-chain credit ledger
- Credit verification mechanisms

## Reputation Systems

Planned reputation features for future versions:

- Seeder reputation based on successful channel closes
- Leecher trust scores
- Rate limiting for channel creation per wallet
- Proof-of-bandwidth mechanisms
